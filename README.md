# UdacityMap

 It allows to post user-generated location information to a shared map, pulling the locations of fellow Udacity's Nanodegree students, with custom messages about themselves or their learning experience.

## Getting Started

All that's required for this project to run is Xcode 8.3.3+ and an internet connection.

## Contribute
